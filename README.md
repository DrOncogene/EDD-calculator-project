# EDD-EGA-calculator-project
A web app that takes in the date of last menstrual period and today's date or any date at which the estimated gestational age is to be calculated and outputs the EGA and EDD. Built with vanilla JS and bootstrap 4.
ES6 classes and modules were used to build the project
I did it mainly for practise but the logic is quite nice

App hosted at [EDD Calculator](https://edd-ega-calculator.netlify.app)
